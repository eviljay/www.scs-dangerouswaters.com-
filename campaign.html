                REBELLION </span> 
                <p align="left" class="textbody">Struggling with their newfound 
                  democracy and being steered by elected leadership that can ill 
                  afford new military initiatives, the Russian Navy is all but 
                  forgotten. The crews and officers do their best to maintain 
                  their cherished vessels but without the necessary resources 
                  their conditions steadily deteriorate.</p>
                <p align="left" class="textbody">Further, the Russian government 
                  is taking steps that are increasingly authoritarian. In the 
                  Russian Far East, the military responds by staging a mutiny 
                  of massive proportions. The Pacific Fleet in Vladivostok and 
                  Petropavlovsk is seized by the newly formed Russian Rebels.</p>
                <p align="center"><a href="campaign/russia_map2.jpg" target="_blank" class="legal"><img src="campaign/russia_map2_thumb.jpg" width="300" height="296" border="0">

                (click to enlarge)</a></p>
                <p align="left" class="textbody">Moscow responds with the mobilization 
                  of the Northern fleet from Murmansk to put down the rebellion 
                  and to regain control of the heart of their Pacific Fleet forces 
                  and ports. U.S. intelligence gives an ominous warning that ballistic 
                  missile submarines are among the captured assets and cannot 
                  be found in recent satellite imagery.</p>
                <p align="left" class="textbody">The U.S. immediately takes the 
                  initiative in this matter of global security and deploys a naval 
                  task force to the Sea of Okhotsk. However, Russian leadership 
                  maintains that the insurgency is an internal matter subject 
                  to Russian sovereignty and warns the U.S. that any direct involvement 
                  in the conflict will be considered an act of aggression. The 
                  U.S. government disregards the warning and directs Navy officials 
                  to proceed through International waters to the eastern shores 
                  of Russia. The full mobilization of the U.S. and Russian navies 
                  in this volatile region provides opportunities for rival countries 
                  to renew hostilities and alter the established balance of power. 
                </p>
                <p align="left" class="textbody">The military forces of China, 
                  Japan, India, and Taiwan are put on full alert as they brace 
                  for war. The Russian Rebellion is portrayed by Moscow as a &#8220;lawless 
                  act by desperate men resistant to change.&#8221; However U.S. 
                  surveillance and reconnaissance soon discovers that this rebellion 
                  is not so easily explained. Foreign merchant ships and naval 
                  vessels are detected moving covertly amongst the Rebels and 
                  pre-planned alliances are indicated. Perhaps the intentions 
                  of the Rebel forces are not as malevolent as they first appeared. 
                  Russian leadership is consistently quiet when questioned by 
                  the U.S. and maintains the threat that U.S. forces will be attacked 
                  if they interfere in what the Russians insist is an internal 
                  conflict.</p>
                <p align="left" class="textbody">Meanwhile, Chinese forces are 
                  mobilizing. PLAN officials claim that the PRC is merely defending 
                  itself from the potentially devastating and potent force of 
                  both Russian government forces and rogue military assets controlled 
                  by the Rebels. However, the sudden build-up of substantial Chinese 
                  forces in the Taiwan Strait intimidates the Taiwanese and they 
                  initiate defensive war plans. The eastern world is on the brink 
                  of war, and the outcome is perilously uncertain&#8230;</p>

                <p align="left" class="textbody">In S.C.S. &#8211; Dangerous Waters 
                  you have the choice to participate in the campaign from multiple 
                  perspectives. You can control forces from the U.S., the Russian 
                  Loyalists, the Russian Rebels or the Chinese side, depending 
                  on the mission tasking and objectives. Your decisions have an 
                  impact not only on the direction of the conflict but may also 
                  dictate the alliances between countries. Those alliances will 
                  remain persistent for multiple missions or the entire campaign. 
                  However, in many instances the pre-existing alliances will be 
                  decided dynamically from the start of the campaign, and you 
                  must unravel the story behind the Russian conflict and determine 
                  the true intentions of each side. Make the wrong decision and 
                  the enemy forces you chose to destroy earlier in the campaign 
                  will no longer be available to defend you once the true alliances 
                  are revealed.</p>

                  Background.</span><br>
                  <span class="textbodyBold">A.</span> For months, the Russian 
                  government has been increasingly repressive and anti-democratic. 
                  The recent elections were marked by both intimidation of independent 
                  parties and apparent electoral fraud. The incumbent party won 
                  by a 99.8% landslide, but voter turnout was weak, especially 
                  in the outlying provinces. The far eastern provinces have seen 
                  especially strident protest, which has recently threatened to 
                  turn violent. Following a bloodless coup, the Russian far eastern 
                  provinces have seceded from Russia, and are under the control 
                  of a cabal of rebellious military officers. There has been no 
                  official communications from the rebels, and their identity 
                  and intentions are unknown. The Russian government in Moscow 
                  has issued a terse announcement of the coup, and stated that 
                  it does not accept the secession. Other governments, including 
                  the United States, have taken a wait-and-see position and expected 
                  clarification of the rebel political intentions.</p>

                  Russian intelligence had provided an early warning of potential 
                  trouble in the Far East, and the government responded by sending 
                  submarines from the Northern Fleet under the ice to the Pacific. 
                  Surface ships and SSBNs commanded by local captains sortied 
                  from Petropavlosk and Vladivostok in an apparent attempt to 
                  avoid losing control of the entire pacific fleet.</p>
                <p align="left" class="textbody"><br>
                  <span class="textbodyBold">C. </span>The rebels are assumed 
                  to be in control of the remaining ships, which may include SSBN 
                  submarines that were being repaired and were unable to get underway. 
                  No warships have been observed leaving either port since the 
                  coup. In addition to the intentions of the rebels, there is 
                  concern that they might attempt to sell Russian military hardware. 
                  Possibly including nuclear and biochemical weapons and technology, 
                  in an attempt to gain assistance and secure funding.</p>

                  Background</span><br>
                  <span class="textbodyBold">A.</span> For months, the Russian 
                  government has been increasingly repressive and anti-democratic. 
                  The recent elections were marked by both intimidation of independent 
                  parties and apparent electoral fraud. The incumbent party won 
                  by a 99.8% landslide, but voter turnout was weak, especially 
                  in the outlying provinces. The far eastern provinces have seen 
                  especially strident protest, which has recently threatened to 
                  turn violent. Following a bloodless coup, the Russian far eastern 
                  provinces have seceded from Russia, and are under the control 
                  of a cabal of rebellious military officers. There has been no 
                  official communications from the rebels, and their identity 
                  and intentions are unknown. The Russian government in Moscow 
                  has issued a terse announcement of the coup, and stated that 
                  it does not accept the secession. Other governments, including 
                  the United States, have taken a wait-and-see position and expected 
                  clarification of the rebel political intentions.</p>
                <p align="center"><a href="campaign/petropavlovsk_map_p3.jpg" target="_blank" class="legal"><img src="campaign/petropavlovsk_map_p3_thumb.jpg" width="300" height="225" border="0"><br>

                <p align="left" class="textbody"><span class="textbodyBold">B.</span> 
                  Russian intelligence had provided an early warning of potential 
                  trouble in the Far East, and the government responded by sending 
                  submarines from the Northern Fleet under the ice to the Pacific. 
                  Surface ships and SSBNs commanded by local captains sortied 
                  from Petropavlosk and Vladivostok in an apparent attempt to 
                  avoid losing control of the entire pacific fleet.</p>
                <p align="left" class="textbody"><br>
                  <span class="textbodyBold">C. </span>The rebels are assumed 
                  to be in control of the remaining ships, which may include SSBN 
                  submarines that were being repaired and were unable to get underway. 
                  No warships have been observed leaving either port since the 
                  coup. In addition to the intentions of the rebels, there is 
                  concern that they might attempt to sell Russian military hardware. 
                  Possibly including nuclear and biochemical weapons and technology, 
                  in an attempt to gain assistance and secure funding.</p>

                  heart of our pacific fleet forces and ports. The treasonous 
                  acts of our former comrades are shameful and will not go unpunished. 
                  As they have cooked this porridge, now they must sleep in it. 
                  We, the only loyal Russians, must take back what is ours and 
                  secure the ports of Petropavlovsk and Vladivostok. Failure to
